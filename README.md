## Hi there! I'm Anthony, a Full-Stack Developer and Current CS Student @UC IRVINE.

I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine (UCI). As a passionate full-stack developer, I thrive on creating dynamic, efficient, and user-friendly applications. My goal is to continually gain hands-on experience through projects and collaborations that sharpen my skills and expand my technical knowledge.
